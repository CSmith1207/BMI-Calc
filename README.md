# How to run the program
1. Make sure your Python is updated to at least 3.9.1, the version this code was written on  
2. Download main.py  
3. Open the file in your interpreter of choice, then run the file  

If you want to also run the tests, make sure you have pytest installed in your environment. Then download test_main.py and place it in the same directory as main.py. Run `pytest -s` in the command line and enter dummy values for feet, inches, and pounds. The values do not matter, the tests do not depend on them. After entering all 3 values, the tests will be run.
